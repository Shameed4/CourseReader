# SBU Course Time Scrape
A script to read all Stony Brook courses from a pdf and turn it into a csv. The pdf is not guaranteed to be up to date or entirely accurate, so I recommend double-checking with SOLAR if a specific class timing is very important to know. The results.csv included in this repo was created on 5/26/2025 for the Fall 2025 courses.

You can download the bulletin pdfs here: https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/registrar/registration/schedules.php?accordion=content-d19e222
